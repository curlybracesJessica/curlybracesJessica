## Hi there 👋  I'm Jessica 💻💃
I'm a 15-year-old science student who’s just as comfortable on the dance stage as I am writing lines of code.
- 💡 A little about me:
  -  ✨ Represented my country in a national dance competition — rhythm is in my code and my moves!
  -  🤖 Learning STEM, Robotics, and AI in school — but I'm more into programming online than building with wires.
  -  🎒 Proud nerd with a flair for fashion — who says you can’t code in style?
  -  👩‍💻 I believe coding should be fun and creative — like building art with logic.

- 🔧 Projects you'll find here: - Beginner-friendly programs -Fun stuff that hopefully makes you say “Whoa, that’s cool!”
